Drag is a form of art that gives you the space to express your feelings, creativity and emotions. Some drag performers perform in clubs, social media platforms, YouTube and other cultural spaces like theater or in music industry.
Some of them serve realness and glamour, others comedy, irony and shade. Beautiful custom gown or a bodysuit from Costco down the street, drag queens make their outfits work no matter the situation.
But what if there is more to drag than nice outfits? How to even do drag? Does it take more than passion and a few bucks in the pocket?

Drag is a spectrum and anything over the top, exaggerated, spooky and weird can fill the definition. However, a lot of money put into things you are so passionate, is also one of the definitions. No matter where you perform, it큦 a common thing to start under a fellow drag queen who can provide you some of the essentials to perform locally for a few tens of dollars a night.
That being said, sometimes it큦 a good idea to audition for Drag Race along the way. Not only you get fame and more gigs, but you also gain a lot of experience and a good Judy.
Drag is worth less than a luxury, and that큦 a fact. However it큦 not a difficult thing to scrap a few fabrics together and make them define your drag. And that큦 in it큦 way, luxurious.
