Drag is a spectrum and anything over the top, exaggerated, spooky and weird can fill the definition. However, a lot of money put into things you are so passionate, is also one of the definitions. No matter where you perform, it큦 a common thing to start under a fellow drag queen who can provide you some of the essentials to perform locally for a few tens of dollars a night.
That being said, sometimes it큦 a good idea to audition for Drag Race along the way. Not only you get fame and more gigs, but you also gain a lot of experience and a good Judy.
Drag is worth less than a luxury, and that큦 a fact. However it큦 not a difficult thing to scrap a few fabrics together and make them define your drag. And that큦 in it큦 way, luxurious.
