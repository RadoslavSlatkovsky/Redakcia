Drag is a form of art that gives you the space to express your feelings, creativity and emotions. Some drag performers perform in clubs, social media platforms, YouTube and other cultural spaces like theater or in music industry.
Some of them serve realness and glamour, others comedy, irony and shade. Beautiful custom gown or a bodysuit from Costco down the street, drag queens make their outfits work no matter the situation.
But what if there is more to drag than nice outfits? How to even do drag? Does it take more than passion and a few bucks in the pocket?

From make-up to wigs, from dresses to shoes. Drag is not an eazy trick to pull off without all these things. So how much would it cost altogether? We asked our local drag performer Coco Peru.
"I´ve been doing drag for almost 40 years and let me tell you honey, it takes a lot of money to look this cheap. Now of course, the bussiness is running and I can afford to throw a penny for a nice pair of shoes here and there but some of the younger kids who started out fresh might have it much tougher than me." said the performer.
Make-up is essential for this job and it can cost you over 400$ for all nessessary products. Wigs and clothing are also needed, and a fancy wig can cost you around 200$ as well. Custom dress can be high in prices, while a dress for 35$ might not be as much hurtful for your wallet, even if it´s not a very tasteful piece of fabric.
